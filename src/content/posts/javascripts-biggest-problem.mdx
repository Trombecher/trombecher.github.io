JavaScript bundlers are dumb, and it's not their fault. It's the language's fault. Let's talk about it.

...

Bundlers are not able to minify property keys of objects because they might be accessed dynamically during runtime (e.g. by bracket + string indexing).

Bundlers are not able to turn classes into functions.

Bundlers are not able to turn functions into arrow functions because they cannot ensure that no one uses them to create an object with `new`.

Because JavaScript relies on so much runtime complexity, bundlers are limited in the way they can modify the source code.

The solution? Make a different language that has Rust-like compile time complexity and optimized JavaScript output.
