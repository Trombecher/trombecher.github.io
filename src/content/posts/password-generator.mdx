## Security

The passwords are generated by **client side JavaScript code, backed by cryptographic randomness** and are **NOT** sent to the server or anywhere (you can check this by examining the developer tools, under the tab _Network_).

If hackers have access to **your** client/browser (including screen, PC or memory) while you are generating passwords, your password(s) are compromised.

Read more at the [privacy policy](/privacy-policy/).

### Extensions

Every extension you have installed in your browser is a security risk. If extensions have access to this page, your security and password(s) may be compromised. Please make sure that **no extension or program on your PC has direct access to your clipboard**. Please also make sure that you have [deactivated Windows Clipboard History](/how-to-deactivate-windows-clipboard-history/).
