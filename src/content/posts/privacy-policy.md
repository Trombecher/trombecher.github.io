We believe that privacy is essential in the internet. This is why this document exists, to inform users of this site
about this site's data collection.

## Applicability

By using or accessing this site in any manner, you accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy notice.

## Servers

This site is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This means that every request to this site will go to
their servers. Therefore,
the [privacy policy of GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement)
applies to some extent.

The servers are nothing but basic file servers. That means that they are not capable of processing any incoming data.
All they can do is serve static content.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data. We do not use cookies. We do not use any tracking software. We do not share any data.**

Any data you input on this site stays locally on your device. The data may be stored in _LocalStorage_ or
_SessionStorage_, which are site-local data-stores. More about
them [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API).

## Security

Although this privacy policy applies, this does not guarantee that your data is secure. Please use a secure connection,
including HTTPS to connect to this site. Otherwise, your security may be compromised. Services, provided on this site,
rely on a secure connection to ensure safety.

If you paste data from your clipboard, it is advised to deactivate any clipboard history functionality on your
system, [particularly Windows](/how-to-deactivate-windows-clipboard-history/).

## Interest

We do not pay any amount of money to host this site, as GitHub Pages is a free service. I (Tobias Hillemanns) develop
this site for fun, not intending any business interest.

This is why it is of **no interest** of us to collect, share and/or sell your data.

## Third Party Content And Links

For any external / third-party content, their respective privacy policies apply.

## Updates To This Policy

This privacy notice may be updated or revoked at any time. A notice will be visible on this site, indicating changes.

## Contact

If you believe that there is an error in this privacy policy, or you feel that your personal rights have been
irrefutably violated, please contact us on any [social platform displayed on the homepage](/).

If you want to improve this site or want to contribute,
