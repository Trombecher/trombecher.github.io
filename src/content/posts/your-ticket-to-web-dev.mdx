So you want to get into web dev, huh?

Well, I've got you covered. During my journey though the web I have collected countless tools, sources and other stuff that I am pleased to share with you here.

## FAQ

### _How to create a website?_

...

### _Which bundler to use?_

When I got into web dev I used [npm](https://nodejs.org/en) which comes by default when installing Node. At that time [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) were rising. Eventually I got into pnpm due to [this video from Theo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIKDJBrk56k) (it is even displayed on their home page!). I smiled as I deleted several `node_modules` folders, each about 0.5GB.

At the time of writing this I mainly use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as it is [considerably faster](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/tree/main/bench/react-hello-world) and more flexible to work with. **I recommend you use Bun.**
