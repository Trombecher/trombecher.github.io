## Windows 11

Open the _Settings_ application on your machine.

Then go to _System_ â†’ _Clipboard_ and turn off _Clipboard history_. It is as easy as it sounds.

How to check that it worked, press <kbd>WIN+V</kbd> and the window should recommend you turning on clipboard history. Don't do it (Windows is cheeky).

## Windows 10

Coming soon :P
